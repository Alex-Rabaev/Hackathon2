Hello Aleksandr,

I've reviewed your Django project, and I'd like to provide you with some feedback:

- Your project structure and file organization is commendable. The separation of the 'games' app from the authentication responsible 'accounts' app is a practical approach, which reflects your understanding of proper Django project structuring.

- In terms of code readability and formatting, your project mostly adheres to PEP 8 standards. However, there's a lot of commented code present in the codebase. If it's not being used or is part of future implementations, it'd be helpful to indicate that specifically. It helps maintain a cleaner and more readable codebase.

- When it comes to using Django and Django REST Framework features, you've demonstrated a sound understanding. However, importing a model from another app into the serializers can mix things up. It would be better to create another serializers.py file inside the 'games' app for better separation of concerns.

- I was particularly impressed by your database modeling. Your models are well defined, and relationships are correctly laid out.

- Your views and URL design are pretty well structured. However, there needs to be clearer separation between the API app and the regular Django app. Your usage of routers.DefaultRouter() is appreciated as it's a best practice for REST framework.

- Your error handling and validation needs some more attention. Make sure to consider edge cases for your models and views. Implementing validations and proper error handling using try-except blocks can be a great step in that direction.

- I noticed a lack of documentation, particularly for functions and classes. Including meaningful comments and providing clear documentation not only helps others understand your code but also proves beneficial when you return to your own code after some time.

Lastly, I want to touch on a few more points. Your integration with JavaScript is a good indication that you're on the right path towards becoming a full-stack developer. However, I noticed that you're including API keys directly in script.js and script2.js. This is not a recommended practice for security reasons. It's better to find a safer way to handle API keys. Also, it's great to see you leveraging Django's template inheritance using 'extends' and 'includes'. It makes your templates cleaner and more maintainable.

Keep up the good work and continue refining your skills. Don't forget to keep security in mind when you're developing your applications. 

Best regards.

Yossi
